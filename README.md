# EXP.NO.1-EXPERIMENTAL-VERIFICATION-OF-VARIOUS-TYPES-OF-SAMPLING-TECHNIQUES
 

1.Experimental Verification Of Signal Sampling Using Various Types Such as 

    i) Natural Sampling
    
    ii) Flat Top Sampling

## AIM:
 To perform experimental verification of various types of sampling such as natural sampling and flat top sampling.
 
## APPARATUS REQUIRED:
Trainer Kit, DSO(10MHz) , Patch Cords and Power Supply (0-30V).

## PROCEDURE:
# Natural Sampling
1.Switch ON the trainer kit and power supply.

2.Set the function generator:

3.Generate a sine wave signal.

4.Frequency: 1 kHz,Amplitude: 2 V peak-to-peak and Set the pulse generator.

5.Generate a square wave (pulse train).Frequency: 8–10 kHz

6.Pulse width: narrow (e.g., 10 µs)

7.Connect the sine wave and pulse signal to the multiplier circuit (provided on the trainer kit or built using an analog switch like CD4016).

8.The output of the multiplier circuit is the naturally sampled signal.Connect the output to the DSO using patch cords.

# FLAT TOP SAMPLING:
1.Switch ON the trainer kit and DC power supply.

2.Set the function generator:

3.Generate a sine wave signal.Frequency: 1 kHz and Amplitude: 2 V peak-to-peak,Set the pulse generator:Generate a square wave (sampling pulses).Frequency: 8–10 kHz

4.Pulse width: short (10–20 µs),Connect the sine wave to the input of the sample-and-hold circuit.

5.Connect the pulse signal to the control input (hold command) of the sample-and-hold circuit.

6.The output of the circuit is the flat-top sampled signal.

7.Connect the output to the DSO using patch cords.

## RESULT:
Thus the sapmpling and reconstruction of the given input signal is done using different types of sampling techniques.
